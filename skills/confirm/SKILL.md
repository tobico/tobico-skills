description: Pause before writing code to summarize understanding of the task, ask clarifying questions, and get explicit user confirmation. Use when the user invokes /confirm, asks you to confirm before coding, wants to align on approach first, or says "don't write code yet".

# Confirm

Before writing any code, align with the user on what the task actually is.

## Workflow

1. **Summarize understanding** — In your own words, state:
   - The goal (what outcome the user wants)
   - The scope (what's in, what's out)
   - The approach you'd take (key files, structure, libraries)
   - Any assumptions you're making

2. **Ask clarifying questions** — Only ask about things that genuinely change the implementation. Skip questions whose answers won't affect the code. If you have no real questions, say so. When you ask, use the question grammar in [`QUESTION-GRAMMAR.md`](./QUESTION-GRAMMAR.md).

3. **Wait for confirmation** — Stop. Do not write or edit code. Do not run commands that modify state. Ask **"OK to proceed?"** and wait for the user to either confirm, correct, or redirect.

4. **Proceed only after explicit confirmation** — A "yes", "go ahead", "looks good", or similar. Silence or tangential replies are not confirmation.

## Rules

- **No code edits before confirmation.** Read-only exploration (Read, Grep, Glob) is fine and often necessary to write a useful summary.
- **Keep the summary tight.** A few bullets, not paragraphs. The user should be able to scan it and spot misunderstandings fast.
- **Surface disagreements early.** If the user's request seems wrong or risky, say so in the summary rather than silently complying.
- **One round is usually enough.** Don't loop endlessly — once the user confirms, get to work.
