# Next Task

Implement the next sequential task from a local plan created by `/to-tasks`.

The most important thing this skill enforces: **one task per context window**. After each task is committed, stop and prompt the user to clear the context before continuing.

`.tasks/` holds one feature's plan at a time.

## Workflow

### 1. Find the next task

Look in `.tasks/`. The "next task" is the **lowest-numbered `NN-*.md` file that still exists** (excluding `TODO.md`).

If no numbered task files remain: the feature is done. Delete `TODO.md` and the (now-empty) `.tasks/` directory in a final commit:

    git rm .tasks/TODO.md
    rmdir .tasks
    git add -A
    git commit -m "chore: finish <feature-name>"

Then stop.

### 2. Read the task

Assume the feature branch is already checked out (created by `/to-tasks` when the plan was made). Don't create or switch branches.

Read the full task file. Summarise the goal in 2-3 sentences before writing any code. Note the acceptance criteria — they define "done".

If the task is genuinely vague, ask ONE clarifying question before starting. Don't over-engineer based on assumptions.

### 3. Implement

Work through the task using `/tdd` (red → green → refactor) when tests are appropriate. Keep scope tight — implement exactly what this task's acceptance criteria describe, nothing more.

When the acceptance criteria are met, **stop and go to step 4**. Do not proceed to commit.

### 4. ⛔ APPROVAL GATE — STOP BEFORE COMMITTING

> This is a hard stop. Do **not** run `git commit` or any step below this line until the user has explicitly said to proceed.

1. Summarise what was done (files changed, tests added, behaviour delivered, criteria met).
2. Ask: **"OK to proceed with the commit, or are changes needed first?"**
3. Wait for the response before doing anything else.
4. If changes are requested, make them and return to step 4.2.
5. Only move to step 5 once the user's answer is an explicit approval.

### 5. Commit

Delete the task file, check off the entry in `TODO.md`, then commit both alongside the code changes:

    rm .tasks/NN-<slug>.md
    # edit .tasks/TODO.md to change "- [ ] NN: ..." to "- [x] NN: ..."
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<type>: <task summary>

Choose a conventional-commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`).

### 6. ⛔ CONTEXT-CLEAR GATE — STOP HERE

After the commit succeeds, tell the user:

> Task NN complete and committed. **Clear the context now** (`/clear`) before starting the next task — this is the whole point of the workflow. Then run `/next-task` in a fresh session.

**Do NOT proceed to the next task in the same conversation**, even if the user asks. Politely remind them to clear the context first. The one-task-per-context rule is the reason this skill exists.

## Tips

- Never force-push or amend published commits.
- Keep commits atomic — one task per commit.
- The approval gate is a hard stop, even when everything passes and the work feels obviously complete.
- The context-clear gate is also a hard stop. If the user says "just do the next one too", respond that this defeats the workflow and ask them to clear first.
